This is a basic game engine built with C++ and Allegro. For more info on Allegro, see here: https://liballeg.org/

Note: This engine uses a library provided by a college professor, and I cannot provide it here. As a result, some minor porting is necessary to use without this library. Almost all of the library references were a data structure called Vector2D, which can be replicated easily.
